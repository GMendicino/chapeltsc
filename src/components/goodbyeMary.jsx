          <p>
            Originally, this doorway led to the library building which is no longer extant. The sculpture above the doorway was not an original part of the Chapelâ€™s furniture, but was a later addition brought from Germany and gifted to the Chapel by Dr. Douglas Strachan in 1944. A work of the early 16th century, it became an important feature of the chapel as a final stop for visitors to say goodbye and pray for safety and health on their journey ahead. She is the Virgin of the Apocalypse and is created in reference to Revelations Chapter 12, which is meant to give encouragement that this life is short with many trials, but evil will not prevail if we seek good.
