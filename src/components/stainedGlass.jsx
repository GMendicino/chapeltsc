          3A Panel two: 
The mid-section panel shows Elphinstone’s return and the beginning of construction of the College, and particularly the building of the Crown tower. Building works did not begin until 1500, due to a need to sink large cut trees to secure the foundation and ensure structural stability. The chapel was completed sometime before 1506, taking approximately six years to build. 
          </p>

          3A Panel three: 
          The last panel is the dedication of the College to James IV of Scotland, and to the Trinity and the Virgin Mary. In the depiction, you can see Bishop Elphinstone greeting King James IV and honouring him with the naming of the College. It also depicts the burial of Elphinstone in the King’s College Chapel.
