          <h2>The Ante-Chapel</h2>
          <p>
            The Antechapel today provides space to remember those connected to the University who gave their lives in support of freedom during the Great Wars, also known as World War I and II. The window across from the door through which you entered is a testament to honor these students and staff members, with their individual names displayed around the room.
          </p>

          <p>
            The overall structure of the Antechapel has not changed throughout its long history, but it has become much smaller â€” see the Rood Screen link to find out why. Today, the Antechapel serves as a welcoming space for visitors entering the Chapel, with the doors to the Rood Screen kept open. Services and events are still regularly held in the Chapel, and a schedule can be accessed online.
