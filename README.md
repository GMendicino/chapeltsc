# How to Install

To install, simple enter our folder into a coding environment. Ensure that your system has npm installed
through the node.js website to allow it to run npm commands and use our React app.

# Installing React Router

To enable effective links between pages, we needed to install React Router which can be downloaded through putting: npm install react-router-dom into the command line.

# Installing React Pannellum

To enable the view and navigation of panoramic images, we needed to install React Pannellum. To install this, simply
put npm install react-pannellum into the command line.

# Install Firebase Functions

To enable communication with our Firebase database simple type npm install firebase into the terminal.


# Getting Started with Create React App (Supplied by React)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# The Purpose of our Application

Our application was made to solve a big issue, the lack of tourists arriving to the Aberdeen University Chapel.

# Testing Our Application

Testing our application is simple, as it says above, through using npm start, the application is run within local host.
This can be used to see all of our features the same way it would be if its were hosted.

# Deployment

To deploy our application, we used a hosting website called Render in which we could link our shared repository
to host our application without having to worry about pipelines.

# Entending Our System

In future, if someone were to want to extend our system, we would add them to the shared repository in which they
could continue to build on top of the application and add useful features and quality of life updates.
